how to set color themes
-----------------------

find a theme, such as:
https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next
https://github.com/tomasr/molokai

##### For NeoVim:

download the .vim file to ~/.config/nvim/colors (create the colors directory 
if it does not exist)

in init.vim file, add the following line:

colorscheme OceanicNext

the name must match the basename of the theme file (less .vim extension)
